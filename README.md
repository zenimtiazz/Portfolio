## Portfolio :movie_camera:
 - I created my portfolio using React & Scss.
 - It was so difficult for me to do that because first time using react and creating portfolio obviously You have to understand thing and get started so quite challenging for me.
 - But yes life is not as easy as we think :wink: one step you go further and new challenge is waiting for you :cry: I created now I think deployment won't be as tough as LOOKING FOR HEROKU documentation.
 - I got alot of error while deploying log errors, modules missing, buildpack and alot more :disappointed:
 - Thanks to MINJIE who helped me in deployment process.

### ta-daaa I finally did it :tada:
