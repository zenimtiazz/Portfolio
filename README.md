## Portfolio :movie_camera:
 >  I created my portfolio using React & Scss.

### React?
```

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

React is used to build single-page applications.

React allows us to create reusable UI components 
```
#### React Hooks:
- useState :heavy_check_mark:
- useEffect :heavy_check_mark:
- useRef   :heavy_check_mark:

> First let me tell you about the hooks:

```
Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.

```
### Styling React using sass:

```
Sass is a CSS pre-processor.

Sass files are executed on the server and sends CSS to the browser.

If you use the create-react-app in your project, you can easily install and use Sass in your React projects.

Install Sass by running this command in your terminal: npm i sass


```
### Challenge :
 - It was so difficult for me to do that because first time using react and creating portfolio obviously You have to understand things and get started so it was quite challenging for me.
 - But yes life is not as easy as we think :wink: one step you go further and new challenge is waiting for you :cry: So I finsihed creating website and now the last step is to deploy and I was thinking deployment won't be as tough as development because LOOKING FOR HEROKU(container-based cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS)) documentation seems quite easy process BUT :angry:.
 - I got alot of error while deploying encountered log errors, modules missing, buildpack and many more :disappointed:
 - Thanks to MINJIE who helped me in deployment process.

### ta-daaa finally  I  did it :tada:
